# Fallstar - Catch the Falling Objects

A beginner-friendly game built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript only**. No frameworks or complex tooling—easily editable in Notepad or any code editor.

## 🎮 How to Play

- **Move** the basket with your mouse or touch to catch falling objects
- **60 seconds** to score as high as you can
- **Normal fruits** (red, teal, yellow) = 1 point
- **Golden 2× fruit** = double points!
- **Bomb** (dark square) = -1 point, avoid it!
- Build **combos** by catching fruits in a row for bonus points (up to 5×)
